## Erin Werner

Statistics is a broad field with applications in many industries. Furthermore, data analysis requires descriptive statistics and probability theory, at a minimum. These concepts will help one make better business decisions from data. Overall, statistics allows people to use a limited sample to make intelligent and accurate conclusions about a greater population. This allows one to make good decisions about issues that involve uncertainty.
