# Statistics for Data Science

## Erin Werner

Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics dealing with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation. It is a broad field with applications in many industries. Furthermore, data analysis requires descriptive statistics and probability theory, at a minimum, in order to derive useful insights from the data. Overall, statistics allows people to use a limited sample of data to make intelligent and accurate conclusions about a greater population. This allows one to make good buisness decisions about issues that involve uncertainty.
